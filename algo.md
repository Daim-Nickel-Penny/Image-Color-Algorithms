## Method 1

To get the average color from an image:

- Load the image into TypeScript using the `Image object` or a similar method.
- Once the image is loaded, you can access its pixel data using the `getImageData()` method of the `CanvasRenderingContext2D object`. This method returns an `ImageData object`, which contains the pixel data for the image as a one-dimensional array of integers representing the `RGBA` values of each pixel.
- Iterate through the pixel data array and compute the average color by summing the values of all the pixels and dividing by the total number of pixels.
- Return the average color as an RGBA tuple (array of four values representing red, green, blue, and alpha).

## Method 2

- Install the canvas package, which provides the Canvas class needed to access the pixel data of an image. You can install it using the following command:
  Copy code
  `npm install canvas`
- Load the image into TypeScript using the Canvas.loadImage() function. This function returns a Promise that resolves with an Image object representing the image.
- Once the image is loaded, you can access its pixel data using the getImageData() method of the CanvasRenderingContext2D object. This method returns an ImageData object, which contains the pixel data for the image as a one-dimensional array of integers representing the RGBA values of each pixel.

- Iterate through the pixel data array and compute the average color by summing the values of all the pixels and dividing by the total number of pixels.

- Return the average color as an RGBA tuple (array of four values representing red, green, blue, and alpha).
